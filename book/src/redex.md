# Why PLT Redex?

MIR Formality is written in PLT Redex, a dialect of Racket,
a LISP-like language popular in programming language research.

I chose to use PLT Redex because it's a really great tool for exploration.
It allows you to write very high-level structures, execute them, and see what happens.

I think it's sufficiently approachable that we can onboard contributors and grow the types team.
I'm not sure the same is true of other alternatives.

Plus I like it.
